### Temporary Title: United Learning - A Distributed Machine Learning Intrusion Detection Model for Wireless Sensor Networks
(United, Allied, Synergistic, Integrated, Associated, Networked) Learning

Author: Hongwei Zhang


### Abstract:  
This is a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) Intrusion Detection model which includes a server and multiple clients (WSN nodes). Each client has a machine learning model trained using sensor data, and in the server, there is a model trained using network traffic data. The clients encrypt and compress the trained local model and send it to the server. The server receives the models, decompresses and decrypts them and saves the local models to the server. Once the WSN simulation starts, the sensors in the nodes will collect new sensing data, these data need to pass the validation of the local models first. The data that passes the validation will be sent to the server and the data that does not pass will be discarded. Once the server receives the sensed data, it will validate the sensor data and the network traffic generated by the transmitted data by aggregated prediction method to give the final validation result. If the data passes the validation, the data is saved, otherwise, the data is discarded.

### Getting Started:
1. Start the server and clients, train the models, transfer the models, and save the models. Open two terminals, one for the server and another for the clients.   
     1. In the first terminal, load the helper and start the server:   
         ```bash   
         python helper.py
         python server.py
         ```   
      
     2. In the second terminal, run each of the three clients:   
         ```bash
         # Note: Run the next client only after seeing the previous client's task completed in the server terminal.
         python client1.py
         python client2.py
         python client3.py
         ```
 
2. Test the models using the model aggregated prediction methods in file `aggregated_predict.py`. Run file `Demo_Aggregated_Prediction.ipynb`. This step should be integrated into the server in the WSN simulation,  it is separated here for ease of demonstration.    



### Results:
1. Server running results (first terminal):
   ```bash
